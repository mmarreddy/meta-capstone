This project was created for the final capstone project to complete the Meta front-end developer certification. It has a home page, reservation page, and a menu page. The reservation page allows users to book a reservation and ensures to show them only open slots for the date they choose. Additionally, the added menu page uses Spoonacular API to display menu items based on the type the user wants.
